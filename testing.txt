Unit Testing Plan — Bus Stop Simulation (Alpha)

Goal:
Make sure small parts (functions) work before running the full simulation.
We will test:
1) stage_from_string(): turns "WAITING"/"ONBUS"/"LEFT" into the right number.
2) insert_from_csv_line(): reads one CSV line and puts the passenger ID into
   the correct list inside the map.

How I will test:
I will use a tiny C++ program (driver). It calls the functions with good and bad
inputs and prints simple messages. For example, "WAITING" should map to the
WAITING number. A wrong word like "BOARDING" should be rejected (-1). For CSV
lines, good lines go into the map; bad lines are ignored.

Expected result:
The test will print the counts for each list. If the counts match what we expect,
the test passed.
