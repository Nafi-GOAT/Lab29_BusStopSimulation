Project Overview — Bus Stop Discrete-Event Simulation

Goal:
Simulate people moving through a small bus system over time. Each stop has people who are
WAITING, ONBUS, or LEFT (finished their trip). The simulation is time-based (discrete
periods) and shows how counts change at each stop.

Data Model:
I will use std::map<std::string, std::array<std::list<std::string>, 3>>.
- Key (map): stop name like "Stop-A", "Stop-B", "Stop-C".
- Value (array of three lists):
  [0] WAITING: passenger IDs waiting at the stop
  [1] ONBUS:   passenger IDs currently riding
  [2] LEFT:    passenger IDs who finished and left the system

Input:
Data will be read from an external CSV file (at least 100 lines for the final project),
one passenger per line, like:
Stop-A,WAITING,P001
Stop-B,ONBUS,P114
Stop-C,LEFT,P300

Events Each Period:
- Some WAITING passengers board the bus → move to ONBUS.
- Some ONBUS passengers finish and get off → move to LEFT.
- Occasionally new WAITING passengers arrive at a stop.

Time:
I will simulate at least 25 time periods (e.g., t = 1..25) and print the state at the
start and after selected periods.

Functions:
- stage_from_string(): convert text to index 0/1/2
- load_data(path, env): read CSV into the map
- print_env(env, period): print a compact table of counts
- simulate_step(env, t): perform one period of moves

What the Program Shows:
Initial counts per stop, then how people flow from WAITING → ONBUS → LEFT across time.
This demonstrates a discrete-event simulation with the required nested data structure
and file input.
