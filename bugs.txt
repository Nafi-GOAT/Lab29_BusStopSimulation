Bug Log — Bus Stop Simulation (Beta Version)

1. File not found error — fixed by checking file open status in load_data().
2. Wrong output order — fixed by using std::setw() formatting in print_env().
3. Crash on empty lines — added line.empty() check in load_data().
4. Incorrect stage mapping — added default return -1 in stage_from_string().
5. Duplicated int main() — removed extra definition.
6. Passengers not moving properly — fixed simulate_step() logic (FIFO lists).
7. Wrong counts shown after time step — corrected print_env() call every 5 steps.
8. New passengers not appearing — fixed by adding t % 3 condition in simulate_step().
9. CSV lines with wrong stage — fixed by ignoring bad stage index (<0).
10. Extra blank output lines — reduced unnecessary endl calls.
